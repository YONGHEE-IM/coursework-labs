何処に行けばいい 貴方と離れて
今は過ぎ去った 時間に問い掛けて
長すぎた夜に 旅立ちを夢見た
異国の空見つめて 孤独を抱きしめた
流れる涙を 時間の風に重ねて
終わらない貴方の 吐息を感じて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
Loneliness your silent whisper
Fills a river of tears through the night
Memory you never let me cry
And you, you never said good-bye
Sometimes our tears blinded the love
We lost our dreams along the way
But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates
Never thought you'd leave me alone
Time through the rain has set me free
Sands of time will keep your memory
Love everlasting fades away
Alive within your beatless heart
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
終わらない悲しみを 青い薔薇に変えて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
流れる涙を 時代の風に重ねて
終わらない貴方の 吐息を感じて
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
Dry your tears with love
If you could have told me everything
You would have found what love is
If you could have told me what was on your mind
I would have shown you the way
Someday, I'm gonna be older than you
I've never thought beyond that time
I've never imagined the pictures of that life
For now, I will try to live for you and for me
I will try to live
Try to live with love
With dreams
And forever with tears
